## Intro

Code Cutter is a tool to assist assessing Toy Robot implementations that come in form recruitment candidates.

It presents a user with a series of questions in four categories:

A report will be generated as a result of answering the quesitons which will summarise candidate's strengths and areas for improvement.

## Work Pipeline

-- Grand total as compared to the max score

- Form styling
